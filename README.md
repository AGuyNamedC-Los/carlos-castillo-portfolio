# [Carlos Castillo Website Portfolio](https://carlos-castillo-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)

A website showcasing my projects and links to my LinkedIn, Github, and resume.

# Description

This website is my second iteration of a portfolio website as a means to have all my important work and criteria in one easy to find place. 

# Motivation

To have more of an online precense and means for people to contact me and view my work. I also used it as an opportunity for practice creating websites using React.
